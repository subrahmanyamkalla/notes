/etc/yum.repos.d/
dnf install 

dnf list installed

dnf list available (to check available packages)

dnf list installed | wc -l (to know the word count also)

dnf remove packagename (to remove installed package)





how can check cpuinfo, memory info, OS
cat /etc/os-release (os information)
cat /proc/cpuinfo (processor info)
cat /proc/meminfo (ram info)

Service Management

serive start, service stop, service restart, status check, enable, disable

systemctl status sshd

HTTP --> 80

Nginx --> install this package
