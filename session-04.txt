systemctl restart sshd

now all files will be on suresh name

--------ssh key base authentication for user------

chown -R username:username .ssh (it will change ownership from root to user in user system after given permissions.

private key, suresh

/home/suresh --> authorized_keys

chmod 700 .ssh
