without touching the servers, tasks should automatically update

DNS --> Domain name system
----------
mysql.devops.com --> return IP address

domain registars --> godaddy, hostinger, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.

hostinger --> cheapest way to buy domains

domain name is unique in the universe...

google.com/facebook.com 

computers understand only numbers
humans understand only names

facebook.com --> 18.90.23.217
consider yours is new laptop, opened browser for first time
browser checks its cache for IP of facebook.com
browser contacts OS, for IP address of facebook.com
OS checks its cache now, it is NA...

ISP is responsible for the DNS resolution.

OS is enabled to contact ISP DNS resolver

DNS resolver checks its cache...

Root servers --> 13 servers
top MNC companies and country governments create a non profit organisation to manage these root servers
Oxford --> new english words adding

DNS resolver contacts nearest root servers...

root server scans the domain you asked for
facebook.com 

TLD --> top level domains
.com, .online, .org, .edu, .in, .uk, .us, .net, .io, .ai, .shop, etc
.siva

Root server informs DNS resolver to contact .com TLD. Root server provides .com TLD address details

DNS resolver contacts .com TLD to provide IP address

TLD checks its system to provide IP address of facebook.com

Records
---------------
A record --> you have to update IP address to your domain

.siva. I should contact root servers that I started a TLD called .siva

Domain registars are middle man. now I connect all major domain registars to show my domain TLD

Domain registars inform TLD that some one bought facebook.siva domain

Domain registars update nameservers for the domain from TLD....

DNS resolver connects with TLD address... address is nothing but nameservers

mysql -h mysql.daws78s.online -uroot -pExpenseApp@1 < /app/schema/backend.sql

after DNS name (website name configured) that name we can check with below command to check connectivity 

nslookup domain_name


proxy_http_version 1.1;

location /api/ { proxy_pass http://backend.daws78s.online:8080/; }

location /health {
  stub_status on;
  access_log off;
}

hdfcbank.com --> domain
netbanking.hdfcbank.com --> Sub domain

frontend.daws78s.online
daws78s.online

Proxy --> Someone on behalf of you

Frontend proxy, reverse proxy

1. Book the domain
2. Give private IP of database server in A record
3. Understand what is A record
4. If you want to take webhost directly move to AWS then need to NS (name servers) from
    Hostinger to AWS route53 need to configure      
5. Install nginx and you should see welcome page with your domain name

if you want to check particular IP address assigned or not check with below command from data base server

nslookup website_name (to check record names running or not)



** after purchased domain name from third party or aws ...etc
need to configure in hostzones in AWS

then we will get name servers that name servers need to update in (hostinger) it will give authority to AWS by the TLD (Top Level Domain) with Root servers.

it will take time to update
after that domain name will available.
that domain name we need to use to create sub domains with "Record create" (to get sub domain) 

then we will get sub_domain/website.com 

1. if you have MySQL data server from there need to take private IP address
    that address need to use in to create record in route53.
    then u will get MySQL.website.com 
    this address need to mention in backend config file to connect.
